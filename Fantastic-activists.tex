    \begin{abstract}
    	On social media platforms and Twitter in particular, specific classes of users such as \textit{influencers}  have been given satisfactory operational definitions in terms of  network and content metrics.
    	Others, for instance \textit{online activists}, are not less important but their characterisation still requires experimenting.
    	%
    	We make  the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found within temporally and spatially localised \textit{contexts}, i.e., small but topical fragments of the network containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant footprint on Twitter.
    	To explore this hypothesis, we have designed a continuous user profile discovery pipeline that produces an ever-growing dataset of user profiles by harvesting and analysing contexts from the Twitter stream.
    	The profiles dataset includes key network and content-based users metrics, enabling experimentation with user-defined score functions that characterise specific classes of online users.
        The paper describes the design and implementation of  the pipeline and its empirical evaluation on a case study consisting of healthcare-related campaigns in the UK, showing how it supports the operational definitions of online activism, by comparing three experimental ranking functions. The code is publicly available.
