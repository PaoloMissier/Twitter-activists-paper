    \begin{abstract}
    	On social media platforms and Twitter in particular, \textit{influencers} and similar classes of users have been given satisfactory operational definitions in terms of Twitter content metrics.
    	For others, for instance \textit{online activists}, are no less important in practice but have been less precisely defined.
    	We present a dedicated but customisable 
    	
    	Supervised approaches that rely on experts' labelling of users to validate such operational definitions are often questionable, as the labels are typically biased and limited to small validation sets.
    	%
    	In contrast, we suggest a semi-supervised approach that combines two main elements. 
    	Firstly, we identify sets of \textit{contexts}, i.e., small but topical fragments of the network from social events or campaigns that have with a significant footprint on Twitter.
    	We make the hypothesis that such contexts contain meaningful signals to help us recognise activists. 
    	Secondly, we apply network analysis and community detection techniques to identify candidate user profiles within each context, and associate a set of quantitative Twitter-related user metrics to them.
    	As new online contexts occur continuously, this results in an ever-growing, feature-rich dataset of user profiles, which provides an experimental testbed. In our case, we use it to seek ranking functions that correspond to the intuitive notion of online activism.
    	In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the contexts harvesting and dataset population process, and we empirically demonstrate the process in action on a case study consisting of healthcare-related campaigns in the UK, showing how it supports operational definitions of online activism.
