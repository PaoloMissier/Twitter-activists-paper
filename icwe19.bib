	abstract = {During crisis events such as disasters, the need for real-time information retrieval (IR) from microblogs becomes essential. However, the huge amount and the variety of the shared information in real time during such events over-complicates this task. Unlike existing IR approaches based on content analysis, we propose to tackle this problem by using user-centric IR approaches with identifying and tracking prominent microblog users who are susceptible to share relevant and exclusive information at an early stage of each analyzed event phase. This approach ensures real-time access to the valuable microblogs information required by the emergency teams. In this approach, we propose a phase-aware probabilistic model for predicting and ranking prominent microblog users over time according to their behavior using Mixture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Models (MoG-HMM). The model utilizes a new user representation which takes into account both the user and the event specificities over time. This user representation comprises the following new aspects (1) Modeling microblog users behavior evolution by considering the different event phases (2) Characterizing users activity over time through a temporal sequence representation (3) Time-series-based selection of the most discriminative features (4) prominent users prediction using probabilistic phase-aware models learned a priori. We have conducted experiments during flooding events: we trained our identification models using a dataset relative to the “Alpes-Maritimes floods” and we tested its identification performance using a new dataset relative to another flooding disaster “Herault floods”. The achieved results show that our model significantly outperforms phase-unaware models and identifies most of the prominent users at an early stage of each event phase.},

	abstract = {Content in microblogging systems such as Twitter is produced by tens to hundreds of millions of users. This diversity is a notable strength, but also presents the challenge of finding the most interesting and authoritative authors for any given topic. To address this, we first propose a set of features for characterizing social media authors, including both nodal and topical metrics. We then show how probabilistic clustering over this feature space, followed by a within-cluster ranking procedure, can yield a final list of top authors for a given topic. We present results across several topics, along with results from a user study confirming that our method finds authors who are significantly more interesting and authoritative than those resulting from several baseline conditions. Additionally our algorithm is computationally feasible in near real-time scenarios making it an attractive alternative for capturing the rapidly changing dynamics of microblogs.},

@article{Sousa2018,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Dengue is a disease transmitted by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which also transmits the Zika virus and Chikungunya. Unfortunately, the population of different countries has been suffering from the diseases transmitted by this mosquito. The communities should play an important role in combating and preventing the mosquito-borne diseases. However, due to the limited engagement of the population, new solutions need to be used to strengthen the mosquito surveillance. VazaDengue is one of these solutions, which offers the users a web and mobile platform for preventing and combating mosquito-borne diseases. The system relies on social actions of citizens reporting mosquito breeding sites and dengue cases, in which the reports are made available to the community and health agencies. In order to address the limited population engagement, the system proactively monitors social media network as Twitter to enrich the information provided by the system. It processes the natural language text from the network to classify the tweets according to a set of predefined categories. After the classification, the relevant tweets are provided to the users as reports. In this paper, we describe the VazaDengue features including its ability to harvest and classify tweets. Since the VazaDengue system aims to strengthen the entomological surveillance of the mosquito that transmits Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya by providing geolocated reports, we present here two studies to evaluate its potential contributions. The first evaluation uses a survey conducted in the Brazilian community of health agents. The goal is to evaluate the relevance of the classified tweets according to the health agents' perspective. The second study compares the official reports of the 2015–2016 epidemic waves in Brazil with the concentration of mosquito-related tweets found by VazaDengue. The goal is to verify if the concentration of tweets can be used for monitoring the mosquito manifestation in big cities. The results of these two evaluations are encouraging. For instance, we have found that the health agents tend to agree with the relevance of the classified tweets. Moreover, the concentration of tweets is likely to be effective for monitoring big cities. The results of these evaluations are helping us to improve the VazaDengue system further. These improvements will make the VazaDengue system even more useful for combating and preventing the mosquito-borne diseases.},

@article{Overbey2013,
	abstract = {With the recent explosion in availability and use of internet social media, contentious politics is currently undergoing a shift in nature. This shift has resulted in technologically savvy groups of people that utilize these new communication resources to quickly disseminate ideas, influence, news, plans, and opinions in near real time to interested, physically disconnected communities of interest. Here, we investigate activity on Twitter during the 2011 protests and revolution in Egypt by performing an analysis of the structure of direct communications and developing a model based on these analyses. We first compare the network representing the declared friends and followers with the underlying direct communication network based on mentions and retweets, performing an evaluation using goodness of model fits, and including the appropriateness of scale-free assumptions. We also examine this underlying network with an analysis of common structural tendencies by employing exponential random graph models. The network structure of locally focused Twitter communities surrounding contentious political networks tend to have a relatively high density, and a propensity for mutual, transitive, and k-star structures, suggesting that both diffusion of information and back-and-forth communication take place frequently in such networks. More global Twitter networks possess properties corroborative of scale-freeness; however, even locally bounded networks show an evidence of preferential attachment. Based on these observations, we introduce a model to automatically ascertain prominent Twitter users within networks centered on contentious politics. We employ a form of the alpha centrality, which can capably take into account directionality and exogenous prominence, and has ties to non-conservative diffusion. Results indicate a model successful at automatically identifying users that are active and prominent within a given community that agrees well with heuristics and is comparable to other similar models. The model also has advantages over others based on its tunability and robustness in the presence of incomplete data.},

@article{Kardara2015,
	abstract = {Influence theories constitute formal models that identify those individuals that are able to affect and guide their peers through their activity. There is a large body of work on developing such theories, as they have important applications in viral marketing, recommendations, as well as information retrieval. Influence theories are typically evaluated through a manual process that cannot scale to data voluminous enough to draw safe, representative conclusions. To overcome this issue, we introduce in this paper a formalized framework for large-scale, automatic evaluation of topic-specific influence theories that are specialized in Twitter. Basically, it consists of five conjunctive conditions that are indicative of real influence exertion: the first three determine which influence theories are compatible with our framework, while the other two estimate their relative effectiveness. At the core of these two conditions lies a novel metric that assesses the aggregate sentiment of a group of users and allows for estimating how close the behavior of influencers is to that of the entire community. We put our framework into practice using a large-scale test-bed with real data from 75 Twitter communities. In order to select the theories that can be employed in our analysis, we introduce a generic, two-dimensional taxonomy that elucidates their functionality. With its help, we ended up with five established topic-specific theories that are applicable to our settings. The outcomes of our analysis reveal significant differences in their performance. To explain them, we introduce a novel methodology for delving into the internal dynamics of the groups of influencers they define. We use it to analyze the implications of the selected theories and, based on the resulting evidence, we propose a novel partition of influence theories in three major categories with divergent performance.},

In This paper we empirically compare the content of Twitter with a traditional news medium, New York Times, using unsupervised topic modeling. We use a Twitter-LDA model to discover topics from a representative sample of the entire Twitter. We then use text mining techniques to compare these Twitter topics with topics from New York Times, taking into consideration topic categories and types. We also study the relation between the proportions of opinionated tweets and retweets and topic categories and types. Our comparisons show interesting and useful findings for downstream IR or DM applications.},
